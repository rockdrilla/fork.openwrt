Subject: ZEN: INTERACTIVE: Tune EEVDF for interactivity

5.7:
Take "sysctl_sched_nr_migrate" tune from early XanMod builds of 128. As
of 5.7, XanMod uses 256 but that may affect applications that require
timely response to IRQs.

5.15:
Per [a comment][1] on our ZEN INTERACTIVE commit, reducing the cost of
migration causes the system less responsive under high load.  Most
likely the combination of reduced migration cost + the higher number of
tasks that can be migrated at once contributes to this.

To better handle this situation, restore the mainline migration cost
value and also reduce the max number of tasks that can be migrated in
batch from 128 to 64.

If this doesn't help, we'll restore the reduced migration cost and keep
total number of tasks that can be migrated at once to 32.

6.6:
Port the tuning to EEVDF, which removed a couple of settings.

6.7:
Instead of increasing the number of tasks that migrate at once, migrate
the amount acceptable for PREEMPT_RT, but reduce the cost so migrations
occur more often.

This should make CFS/EEVDF behave more like out-of-tree schedulers that
aggressively use idle cores to reduce latency, but without the jank
caused by rebalancing too many tasks at once.
