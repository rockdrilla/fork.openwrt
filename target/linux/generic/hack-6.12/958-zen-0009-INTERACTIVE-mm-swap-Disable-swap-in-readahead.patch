Subject: ZEN: INTERACTIVE: mm/swap: Disable swap-in readahead

Per an [issue][1] on the chromium project, swap-in readahead causes more
jank than not.  This might be caused by poor optimization on the
swapping code, or the fact under memory pressure, we're pulling in pages
we don't need, causing more swapping.

Either way, this is mainline/upstream to Chromium, and ChromeOS
developers care a lot about system responsiveness. Lets implement the
same change so Zen Kernel users benefit.
