Subject: ZEN: ahci: Disable staggered spinup by default

This patch disabled the staggered spinup used for HDDs.

The goal is to make boot times faster on systems
with the small downside of a small spike in power consumption.

Systems with a bunch of HDDs would see considerable faster boots

This does make sense in the zen kernel as its supposed to be a kernel
specialized for desktop performance, and faster boot times does fit
into that description
